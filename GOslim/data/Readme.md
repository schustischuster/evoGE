GO slims (GO subsets) are high level summaries of a GO containing a subset of GO terms. For more information, see [Guide to GO subsets](http://geneontology.org/docs/go-subset-guide/). 

Files containing GO and GO slim annotations for *Arabidopsis thaliana* were downloaded from [TAIR](https://www.arabidopsis.org/download/index-auto.jsp?dir=%2Fdownload_files%2FGO_and_PO_Annotations%2FGene_Ontology_Annotations) (2021-11-01). Additional information can be found within the header of the files.

GO enrichment analysis of orthologous genes from the lowest and highest expression quantile was done using [ShinyGO](http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/) v0.741.
